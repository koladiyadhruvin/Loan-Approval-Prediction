# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and prediction of a Loan Approval status.

Loan Approval Prediction is one of the problems that Machine Learning has solved in fintech businesses like banks and financial institutions. Loan approval prediction means using credit history data of the loan applicants and algorithms to build an intelligent system that can determine loan approvals.

Loan approval prediction involves the analysis of various factors, such as the applicantâ€™s financial history, income, credit rating, employment status, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging historical loan data and applying machine learning algorithms, businesses can build models to determine loan approvals for new applicants.

## Dataset
I found an ideal dataset for the task of Loan Approval Prediction. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication).

ðŸ‘‰ There are **13 variables** in dataset.
- 8 categorical variables,
- 4 continuous variables, and
- 1 variable to accommodate the loan ID.

## Libraries used
- **Pandas** : For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy** : For numerical operations on dataset.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly** : For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn** : For building machine learning models.

## Classification Models used
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

ðŸ‘‰ In general, it can be seen that both models can achieve up to 80% accuracy.

ðŸ‘‰ The highest accuracy is 84%.

## Summary
Loan approval prediction involves the analysis of various factors, such as the applicantâ€™s financial history, income, credit rating, employment status, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging historical loan data and applying machine learning algorithms, businesses can build models to determine loan approvals for new applicants.
